#Question 1
    #create courses 1
    all_coding_classes = CodingClass.all

    all_coding_classes.each do |coding_class|
    Course.create(coding_class_id:coding_class.id, trimester_id:8, max_enrollment:25)
    end

    #create courses 2
    CodingClass.all.each do |coding_class|
    Course.create(coding_class_id: coding_class.id, trimester_id: 8, max_enrollment: 25)
    end

#Question 2
    #create student
    target_student = Student.create(first_name:"Tristan", last_name:"White", email: "Twhite@Gmail.com")

    #create enrollment 
    target_enrollment = Enrollment.create(course_id:44,student_id:target_student.id)

    # create avaliable mentors
    available_mentors = []

#Question 3
    I would like to create a record collection database. All users will have roughly the same roles and access.
    
    A user can register / log in.
    A user can CRUD Records (music album) to their collection 
        A user can add album Art 
        A user can add rating
        A user can grade codintion
        A user can not if it was a digital release only (meaning grade is N/A)
    A user can see other peoples collecitons
    A youtube widget that suggest videos based on the Artist name and album title
    A user can Grade of Record enum: poor, good, very good, mint.

#Question 4
    1 user, album , grade, album art image, Album title, type: digital/vinyl, description, condition.
    2 
        user --> id: interger , name: string , email: string
        Album --> id: interger , title: string, artist: string
        Collection --> the relation of user has_many records
        
        Class User
        has_many collecitons
        has_many albums through collecitons

        Class Album
        has_many collections
        has_many users through collections 

        Class Collection
        belongs_to user
        belongs_to collection

        Tables and columns --> ERD.. I think...
        users
            id: interger
            name: string
            email:string
            password:string
        
        albums
            id: interger
            title: string
            artist: string
            description: text

        collections
            id: interger
            user_id: interger 
            album_id: interger
            condition: enum: poor, good, verygood, mint
            rating: interger 1 - 5 stars? 
            album_art_url: string? 
            format: enum: digital only / vinyl

        conditon is specifc to collecitons becasue it is the conditon of the specific copy the user has.
        for the image , what if I want to upload locally ?
        i know the youtube player is not database related... but... it sounds cool...
